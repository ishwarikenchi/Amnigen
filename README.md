# AnimGen - Text-to-Educational Animation

AnimGen is a React-based platform that converts natural language descriptions into educational animations using the Google Gemini API. It supports 2D and 3D visualizations, including mathematical plots, geometric transformations, and physics concepts.

## Features

- **Text-to-Animation:** Type prompts like "Animate a circle expanding into a sphere" or "Visualize matrix multiplication".
- **3D Rendering Engine:** Custom SVG-based projection engine supporting spheres, cubes, grids, and z-sorting.
- **Mathematical Plotting:** Supports Cartesian and Polar coordinate plotting for functions.
- **AI Integration:** Powered by Google Gemini 2.5 Flash for instruction generation.
- **Exportable Code:** View the underlying JSON script generated by the AI.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher recommended)
- **Google Gemini API Key** (Get one at [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com))

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (or download source files):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd animgen-local
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Create a file named `.env` in the root directory (next to `package.json`). Add your API Key:

   ```env
   # .env file
   API_KEY=AIzaSy...YourKeyHere
   
   # Optional: Custom Port
   PORT=enter your port
   ```
   
   *Note: The app supports `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY`, or `API_KEY`.*

## Running Locally

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

If you configured port 30000, open your browser to `http://localhost:30000`.

## Building for Production

To create an optimized build for deployment (e.g., to Vercel, Netlify, or a web server):

1. **Run the build command**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This compiles TypeScript and bundles the assets into a `dist/` folder.

2. **Preview the build locally**:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

## Project Structure

- **`src/services/geminiService.ts`**: Handles API communication and system prompts.
- **`src/components/AnimationStage.tsx`**: The core rendering engine (SVG + 3D Projection logic).
- **`src/types.ts`**: TypeScript definitions for the Animation Script schema.
- **`vite.config.ts`**: Configuration for the build tool and environment variables.

## Troubleshooting

- **"API Key is missing"**: Ensure your `.env` file is in the root directory and you have restarted the server after creating it.
- **Port issues**: If the port is in use, modify the `PORT` variable in `.env`.
