🎬 AnimGen AI<br>
AI-Powered Educational Animation Generator
AnimGen AI is an intelligent educational platform that automatically converts plain text explanations into animated explainer videos. It is designed to help students, teachers, and content creators understand and teach complex concepts visually—without requiring animation skills or expensive software.

🚀 Project Overview
Traditional learning resources like textbooks, PDFs, and slides often fail to explain abstract or complex topics clearly, especially in subjects such as science, mathematics, and engineering. Creating animated educational videos usually requires time, money, and technical expertise, which most educators and students do not have.
AnimGen AI solves this problem by using Artificial Intelligence to transform simple educational text into structured visual animations. Users input a concept or explanation, and the system intelligently analyzes the content, breaks it into steps, and generates corresponding animated scenes, diagrams, formulas, and visual sequences.
The goal of AnimGen AI is to make high-quality visual learning accessible, affordable, and scalable for everyone.
